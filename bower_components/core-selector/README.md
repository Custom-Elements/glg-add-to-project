core-selector
==============
This fork is modified from the original to simply strip all references to polymer as a dependency in the build system and the html. You must inject polymer yourself at the application root layer in order for this component to work within your application.

See the [component page](http://polymer-project.org/docs/elements/core-elements.html#core-selector) for more information 
about using the api.
