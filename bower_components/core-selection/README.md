core-selection
==============

This fork is modified from the original to simply strip all references
to polymer as a dependency in the build system and the html.  You must
inject polymer yourself at the application root layer in order for this
component to work within your application.

See the [component page](http://polymer-project.org/docs/elements/core-elements.html#core-selection)
  for more information about the api.
